# LegoIos
 Swift app to access the Lego catalog

 My goal is to play around swift and native apis while trying to keep the spagheti code to a minimum level
 That's why depencies won't be accepted and the one used during the first times of the app while disappear

We will be using https://rebrickable.com/ to play around Swift

Please, install ZenHub in order to access the project's board
